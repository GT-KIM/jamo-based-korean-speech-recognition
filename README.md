# jamo-based-korean-speech-recognition (Ongoing)
Simple pytorch implementation of jamo-based korean speech recognition.\
We used KsponSpeech corpus dataset for training/validation.\
We referred to [2]'s preprocessing method and [3]'s model structure. Thank you!

# TODO
- [ ] Write Description
- [ ] Change evaluation metrics (L0 norm --> Levenshtein distance for jamo)
- [ ] Fine tuning & code cleanup

# Data preprocessing
